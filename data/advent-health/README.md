# Advent Health

This data is entirely in XML, although the hospitals use different formats.

 - some use a workbook export
 - others have a single dataroot and then the hospital id.


Data included are a price and description, there is no charge code, however
the descriptions are in all caps, which hints that they might be from some
ontology.

There are several files that were large to download, and thus were downloaded
(and are empty). See the [issue here](https://github.com/vsoch/hospital-chargemaster/issues/5)
and please open a PR to fix for this hospital!

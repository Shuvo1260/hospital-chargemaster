# Advent Health

This data is entirely in XML, although the hospitals use different formats.

 - some use a workbook export
 - others have a single dataroot and then the hospital id.


Data included are a price and description, there is no charge code, however
the descriptions are in all caps, which hints that they might be from some
ontology.
